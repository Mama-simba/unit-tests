# How to Unit Tests


## The challenge

This is a simple homework to learn the basics about what unit tests are, what they are useful for and why it is so important to include them in our projects.

### Built with

- JavaScript
- Git
- NodeJS (npm)
- Jasmine

### What I learned

Thanks to [this article](https://how-to.dev/how-to-start-unit-testing-with-jasmine) I learnt about:

- Unit tests, small pieces of code that check if a project's piece of code works as expected.
- Jasmine, an open-source framework to help testing.
- Basic Git commands (specially gitignore), very important to keep the project's repository clean.
